# Kivi Paperi Sakset
## Description
This repository contains a simple RockPaperScissors game which is played in the console of the IDE of your choice.
It is part of a course at Metropolia and the idea was to refactor the code from a messy spaghetti to a more understandable presentation.
Here you can find the final version of the code refactored by me.
Every file with an author Ira Dook is a part of the original game and the code of the other files are extracted from those files.
Some functions and logics have been changed as well.

## Installation and use
To run the game, you'll need to clone the repository, open the code using your favourite IDE and run a file called `Main.java`.
After this, the program completes itself and tells you who is the winner of the game.
In case you want to run the tests as well, you'll need to add a junit jupiter dependency into the project.
After that, it is possible to begin the testing.
