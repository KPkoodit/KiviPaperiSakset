This repository contains a simple RockPaperScissors game which is played in the console of the IDE of your choice.
It is part of a course at Metropolia and the idea was to refactor the code from a messy spaghetti to a more understandable presentation.
Here you can find the final version of the code refactored by me.
Every file with an author Ira Dook is a part of the original game and the code of other files are extracted from those files.
Some functions and logics have been changed as well.

To run the game, you'll need to clone the repository and run a file called `Main.java`.
The program completes itself and tells you who is the winner of the game.
in case you want to run the tests as well, you'll need to add a junit jupiter dependency into the project.
After that, it is possible to beign the testing.
